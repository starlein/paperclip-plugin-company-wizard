## Gracefully Optimistic Architecture

Start with just a CEO. Everything works. Add roles and responsibilities shift automatically:

| Capability | Primary Owner | Fallback | Module |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------- | :----- |
| `market-analysis` | UX Researcher → CMO → Product Owner | CEO | market-analysis |
| `hiring-review` | Product Owner | CEO | hiring-review |
| `backlog-health` | Product Owner | CEO | backlog |
| `auto-assign` | Product Owner | CEO | auto-assign |
| `user-testing` | QA → UX Researcher → Product Owner | CEO | user-testing |
| `brand-identity` | UI Designer → CMO | CEO | brand-identity |
| `ci-cd` | DevOps | Engineer | ci-cd |
| `monitoring` | DevOps | Engineer | monitoring |
| `tech-stack` | Engineer | CEO | tech-stack |
| `architecture-plan` | Engineer | CEO | architecture-plan |
| `design-system` | UI Designer | Engineer | architecture-plan |
| `pr-review` | Code Reviewer / Product Owner / UI Designer / UX Researcher / QA / DevOps | — | pr-review |
| `threat-model` | Security Engineer → DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `security-review` | Security Engineer → DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `project-docs` | Technical Writer → Engineer | CEO | documentation |
| `competitive-tracking` | Customer Success → CMO → Product Owner | CEO | competitive-intel |
| `accessibility-audit` | QA → UI Designer | Engineer | accessibility |
| `codebase-audit` | Engineer | CEO | codebase-onboarding |
| `issue-triage` | Product Owner → Engineer | CEO | triage |
| `dependency-audit` | DevOps → Security Engineer | Engineer | dependency-management |
| `release-process` | DevOps → Engineer | CEO | release-management |
| `game-design` | Game Designer → Engineer | CEO | game-design |
| `stall-detection` | CEO (always) | — | stall-detection |
| `vision-workshop` | CEO (always) | — | vision-workshop |

**How it works:** Primary owners get the full skill. Fallback owners get a safety-net variant that only activates when the primary is absent or stalled.

> CEO only? The CEO handles everything — market analysis, backlog, auto-assign, and strategy. Add an Engineer and they take over implementation. Add a Product Owner and they take over backlog and auto-assign, with the CEO as fallback.

<details>
<summary><strong>Preset details</strong></summary>

**fast** — Solo engineer, direct-to-main, automated backlog. No review, no planning phase.

**quality** — Full review pipeline. Product Owner manages backlog and product alignment, Code Reviewer gates code quality. Feature branches with PR workflow.

**rad** — Rapid Application Development. Pick a tech stack, start building, hire when you hit bottlenecks. No upfront market research or architecture formalization — prototype first, learn from what you build, formalize later.

**startup** — Strategy-first. Starts with vision, market analysis, tech evaluation, and hiring review before any code. Grow the team through board approvals.

**research** — Planning only. Vision, market research, tech evaluation, and team assessment. No repo, no code workflow. Upgrade to `startup` or `full` when ready to build.

**full** — Everything. Full strategic planning, quality engineering with PR review, team growth via hiring review. Product Owner and Code Reviewer included.

**secure** — Security-first. Threat modeling, security reviews, and quality gates on top of full planning and PR review. Security Engineer, Code Reviewer, and Product Owner included.

**gtm** — Go-to-market focused. Competitive intelligence, market analysis, and brand identity. CMO for marketing strategy, Customer Success for competitive tracking, Product Owner for backlog.

**content** — Content and documentation focused. Technical Writer for developer docs and guides, accessibility for inclusive design, market analysis for positioning.

**website-relaunch** — Relaunch an existing website with external design assets. Site audit, design ingestion, implementation, content migration, QA, and go-live. Includes an inline goal with 5 milestones and 10 issues.

**repo-maintenance** — Custodial maintenance for existing repositories. Agents review and merge open PRs, triage inbound GitHub issues, audit codebase health, manage dependencies, and handle releases. Inline goal bootstraps the team through onboarding, process setup, initial sweep, and steady-state maintenance.

**build-game** — Game development from idea to playable release. Game Designer owns the GDD, mechanics, and balancing. Game Artist generates sprites, textures, and tilesets. Audio Designer creates sound effects and music. Inline goal with 5 milestones: concept, prototype, vertical slice, production, polish & ship.

└── docs/                        # Shared docs (→ company/docs/)
```

**`module.meta.json` schema:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "requires": ["other-module"],
  "activatesWithRoles": ["my-role"],
  "permissions": ["tasks:assign"],
  "adapterOverrides": { "chrome": true },
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "skill": "my-skill",
      "owners": ["my-role", "ceo"],
      "fallbackSkill": "my-skill.fallback"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Initial task",
      "assignTo": "capability:my-skill",
      "description": "Task description"
    }
  ],
  "goal": {
    "title": "My Goal",
    "description": "What this goal achieves",
    "project": true,
    "milestones": [
      { "id": "phase-1", "title": "Phase 1", "project": false }
    ],
    "issues": [
      { "title": "First task", "milestone": "phase-1", "assignTo": "engineer", "priority": "high" }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `requires` | Other modules that must be selected |
| `activatesWithRoles` | Module only applies if one of these roles is present |
| `capabilities[].owners` | Priority order — first present role gets the primary skill |
| `capabilities[].fallbackSkill` | Filename (without `.md`) of the fallback variant |
| `tasks[].assignTo` | A role name or `"capability:<skill>"` to auto-resolve |
| `adapterOverrides` | Adapter config keys merged into all capability owner agents during provisioning |
| `goal` | Optional inline goal. When active, `tasks` are skipped. |
| `goal.project` | If `true` (default), creates a dedicated Paperclip project for this goal |
| `goal.issues[].assignTo` | Role name, `"capability:<skill>"`, or `"user"` (unassigned for human pickup) |

**Skill resolution order** (per role + skill):

1. `agents/<role>/skills/<skill>.md` — role-specific override (wins if present)
2. `skills/<skill>.md` — shared skill (default for any primary owner)

**Doc references in skills** — two kinds of docs end up in `{company}/docs/`:

| Reference | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| Own template (`lowercase-kebab.md`) | Reference directly — assembly guarantees it exists if module is active |
| Cross-module output (`UPPERCASE.md`) | Always conditional: "If `docs/TECH-STACK.md` exists, review it. Otherwise proceed." |

### Add a role

```text
templates/roles/<name>/
├── role.meta.json   # Name, title, base, paperclipRole, reportsTo, adapter
├── AGENTS.md
├── SOUL.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
└── TOOLS.md
```

**`role.meta.json` schema:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-role",
  "title": "My Role",
  "base": false,
  "division": "engineering",
  "tagline": "One-liner for wizard display and AI selection",
  "paperclipRole": "general",
  "description": "What this role does",
  "reportsTo": "ceo",
  "enhances": ["Takes over X from CEO"],
  "adapter": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `base` | `true` for always-present roles (ceo only). Omit or `false` for optional. |
| `division` | Functional grouping: `leadership`, `engineering`, `design`, `product`. Used for display and AI selection. |
| `tagline` | One-liner personality summary for wizard UX and AI wizard selection. |
| `paperclipRole` | Paperclip enum: `ceo`, `engineer`, `pm`, `qa`, `designer`, `cto`, `cmo`, `cfo`, `devops`, `researcher`, `general` |
| `adapter` | Passed to `adapterConfig` during provisioning. |

### Add a preset

Create `templates/presets/<name>/preset.meta.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-preset",
  "description": "What this preset is for",
  "constraints": [],
  "roles": ["product-owner"],
  "modules": ["github-repo", "backlog"],
  "goals": []
}
```

The `goals` array follows the same inline goal schema as `module.meta.json` — see the module schema above.
