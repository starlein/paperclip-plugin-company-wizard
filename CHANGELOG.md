# Changelog

All notable changes to the Company Wizard plugin are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Existing-company provisioning** — the wizard can target an existing Paperclip company instead of creating a new one. New `existingCompanyId` state field and `SET_EXISTING_COMPANY_ID` action in `WizardContext`, a "Target" row in `ConfigReview` with inline edit for pasting a company ID, and a summary button label that adapts ("Provision into Existing Company" vs "Create Company")
- **Approval-aware agent hiring** — `PaperclipClient.createAgent()` now detects when direct creation requires board approval, falls back to `POST /api/companies/{id}/agent-hires`, and auto-approves via `/api/approvals/{id}/approve`. If auto-approve fails, the pending approval ID and error are surfaced in the provisioning log so the board can approve it manually
- **`disableBoardApprovalOnNewCompanies` plugin setting** (boolean, default `false`) — when enabled, new companies are PATCHed to `requireBoardApprovalForNewAgents=false` during provisioning for legacy fully-autonomous bootstrap behavior. Leave off to preserve approval-gated hiring policies
- **`PaperclipClient` methods** — `updateCompany`, `getCompany`, `listAgents`, `getAgent` to support existing-company flows

### Changed

- **CEO resolution for existing companies** — when `existingCompanyId` is set, `start-provision` reuses an active CEO agent if one exists on the company; otherwise it hires a new CEO through the approval-aware path. The bootstrap task title now uses the resolved company name
- **Partial-failure cleanup** — provisioning only deletes companies that were created in the same run. Existing companies are never deleted on error; the log explicitly notes the skipped cleanup
- **`StepDone` messaging** adapts to existing-company mode ("Workspace has been assembled and bootstrap tasks were added to the existing Paperclip company")

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-04-05

### Added

- **`check-ai-config` worker action** — lightweight pre-check that verifies the Anthropic API key is configured. Called on AI wizard mount to show a warning banner with a link to plugin settings before the user starts typing
- **API key warning banner** in the AI wizard describe phase — amber alert with "Plugin Settings" button when `anthropicApiKey` is missing

### Changed

- **Graceful error handling across all worker actions** — `ai-chat`, `start-provision`, `preview-files`, and `refresh-templates` now return `{ error }` instead of throwing. This prevents the plugin host from swallowing error messages in generic 502 responses (fixes [#5](https://github.com/Yesterday-AI/paperclip-plugin-company-wizard/issues/5))
- **`PaperclipClient.connect()`** — wraps the initial fetch in try/catch to surface network errors (wrong port, connection refused) with actionable messages mentioning `paperclipUrl` in plugin settings
- **`PaperclipClient._fetch()`** — same network-error handling for all API calls during a session
- **All error messages** now reference plugin settings fields instead of CLI flags (legacy from the standalone CLI)
- UI components (`StepProvision`, `ConfigReview`, `StepOnboarding`) updated to handle graceful error returns from worker actions

### Fixed

- AI wizard 502 error after first step — error messages from the worker (missing API key, Anthropic API errors, network failures) were lost when the plugin host converted thrown errors to generic 502 responses. Now returned as structured data that flows through to the UI error bar
- "fetch failed" on non-default ports — `PaperclipClient` now catches `TypeError` from `fetch()` and surfaces the configured URL in the error message
- `start-provision` compensation logic preserved — inner try/catch still deletes partially created companies, outer try/catch returns the error gracefully with full provisioning logs

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- `ai-chat` action: `max_tokens` reduced from 16384 to 8192 — 16K caused Paperclip's 30s RPC timeout to trigger before Sonnet could finish generating

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- CEO agent default model: `claude-opus-4-6` (was: no default, Paperclip fallback)
- CEO agent heartbeat interval: 3600s / 1 hour (was: Paperclip default 300s / 5 min)
- `createAgent()` API client now accepts `runtimeConfig` (used for `heartbeat.intervalSec`)

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- Label creation instructions in bootstrap — CEO creates labels before issues, attaches `labelIds`, maintains labels in heartbeat
- `assigneeUserId: → board user` for human-assigned issues (was incorrectly using `assigneeAgentId: → "user"`)

### Changed

- Bootstrap instructions expanded: "How to read the metadata" section explains direct values vs `→` references, documents `assigneeUserId` for board user assignment

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- Bootstrap instructions loaded from `templates/bootstrap-instructions.md` — editable without code changes

### Changed

- BOOTSTRAP.md field names now match Paperclip API exactly: `parentId` (was `parentGoal`), `assigneeAgentId` (was `assignee`), `projectId` (was `project`), `goalIds` (was `goals`)
- References use `→ "name"` syntax to signal the CEO must resolve names to UUIDs
- Company description rendered under `## Company` heading

### Fixed

- BOOTSTRAP.md metadata switched from `<!-- -->` HTML comments to visible `- **key**: value` bullet lists — HTML comments were stripped by Paperclip's markdown renderer

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Routines** — new `routines[]` field in module/preset meta.json for recurring scheduled agent work. Modules `stall-detection`, `auto-assign`, `backlog`, `ci-cd`, `build-api`, and `website-relaunch` now define routines with cron schedules
- `## Routines` section in BOOTSTRAP.md with `<!-- assignee, schedule, concurrencyPolicy -->` frontmatter per routine
- `createRoutine()` and `createRoutineTrigger()` methods in API client
- Subgoal expansion — `goal.subgoals[]` are expanded into the goal hierarchy as nested goals with `level: "team"` and `parentGoal`
- Robust JSON parser — string-aware brace tracking, trailing comma cleanup, markdown code fence fallback, `console.error` debug logging on parse failure
- ConfigReview file grouping — agent files grouped by `agents/<role>/` instead of flat `agents/`
- "Update templates" button on onboarding screen — `refresh-templates` worker action deletes cached templates and re-downloads from GitHub

### Changed

- **Template schema harmonized with Paperclip API** — `milestones[]` → `subgoals[]` (with `id`, `title`, `level`, `description`); `goal.issues[]` removed (issues belong to projects, not goals); `tasks[]` → `issues[]` everywhere
- BOOTSTRAP.md uses `<!-- -->` HTML-comment frontmatter instead of code fences (safe when descriptions contain code blocks)
- BOOTSTRAP.md issue frontmatter: only `assignee` + `project` (removed `milestone`)
- BOOTSTRAP.md provisioning steps show correct goal `level` (not hardcoded to `company`)
- `assembleCompany()` returns `initialIssues` + `initialRoutines` (was `initialTasks`)
- `createGoal()` API client now accepts `status` and `ownerAgentId` fields
- `ai-chat` action: `max_tokens` increased from 1024 to 16384

### Removed

- `GoalMilestone` typedef, `GoalIssue` typedef, `modulesWithActiveGoals()` export
- `milestone` field on template issues
- `completionCriteria` field on milestones (folded into subgoal `description`)
- `generateBootstrapDescription()` — bootstrap issue uses BOOTSTRAP.md directly
- `skipTaskModules` logic — goals no longer contain issues, so no skip needed

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-03-29

### Changed

- `ai-chat` action: `max_tokens` increased from 1024 to 16384 — prevents truncated JSON when AI generates thorough goal descriptions with the new `goals[]`/`projects[]` format

### Fixed

- JSON parser in `tryExtractConfig` now string-aware: brace-depth tracker skips `{`/`}` inside quoted strings, preventing false matches on text like `"Build API with {userId}"`
- JSON parser handles trailing commas, line comments, unescaped newlines/tabs in AI-generated JSON
- JSON parser falls back to markdown code fence extraction (`\`\`\`json ... \`\`\``) when brace tracking finds no valid config
- Added `console.error` debug logging when config parsing fails — raw AI response is now visible in browser devtools

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Bootstrap issue now uses BOOTSTRAP.md content directly as its description — the CEO gets the full company spec, goals, projects, agents, issues, and provisioning steps instead of a generic "set up workspace" message

### Removed

- `generateBootstrapDescription()` — redundant; BOOTSTRAP.md IS the bootstrap issue

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Multi-goal support** — `goals[]` array replaces singular `goal` field; AI wizard generates hierarchical goals with `parentGoal` for sub-goals
- **Multi-project support** — `projects[]` array replaces singular `project` field; projects linked to goals via `goals[]` array (matches Paperclip API `goalIds`)
- `WizardProject` interface (`name`, `description`, `goals[]`) and `Goal.parentGoal` field
- `companyDescription` rendered in BOOTSTRAP.md (was previously only sent to the API)
- Full issue details in BOOTSTRAP.md: descriptions, `[priority]` annotations, `_(milestone: id)_` references
- Full milestone details in BOOTSTRAP.md: descriptions and `_Done when:_` completion criteria
- Preset roles shown in AI wizard catalog — `buildCatalog()` now includes `roles: engineer, ...` for each preset so the AI knows what selecting a preset implies

### Changed

- **BOOTSTRAP.md structure** — unified hierarchy: Goals (### top-level, #### sub-goals) → Projects (with workspace + goal links) → Agents (instructionsFilePath only) → Issues (grouped by goal, annotated with target project) → Provisioning Steps (explicit API creation order)
- **AI wizard config format** — `goal`/`goalDescription`/`project`/`projectDescription` (flat) → `goals: [{title, description, parentGoal?}]` + `projects: [{name, description, goals[]}]` (backward compatible with old format)
- **AI wizard prompts** — `goalDescription` instructions now demand thorough, spec-level detail; system prompts explain `goals[]`/`projects[]` format
- `assembleCompany()` signature — `goal`/`project`/`goals` → `userGoals`/`userProjects`/`inlineGoals`; module inline goals auto-linked as sub-goals of the main user goal
- Agent listings in BOOTSTRAP.md show `instructionsFilePath` only (removed legacy `cwd` field)
- Issues in BOOTSTRAP.md are grouped by goal with `_Project: "name"_` annotation instead of `goalId →` references (issues link to projects, not goals)
- Ungrouped module tasks rendered under "Initial tasks" heading (not under main goal title)

### Fixed

- AI wizard silently dropped preset modules — only roles were merged with AI-selected ones; now both modules and roles are defensively merged from the preset definition
- AI wizard rarely selected engineer — `buildCatalog()` listed presets with modules but not roles, so the AI didn't see that selecting a preset doesn't auto-add its roles
- BOOTSTRAP.md had two confusing issue sections ("Goal: ..." with issues and separate "Initial Tasks") — now unified under single `## Issues`
- `project` and `projectDescription` from AI wizard config were silently ignored — never reached `assembleCompany` or BOOTSTRAP.md

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- `companyDescription` field — AI wizard now generates a comprehensive 2-4 paragraph company description that's stored in `WizardContext` and passed to the Paperclip API when creating the company
- Preset role merging — AI wizard merges preset roles with AI-selected roles so preset roles aren't lost when the AI omits them
- Interview guidance — interview system prompt now covers what to ask about (stage, quality vs speed, team needs, repo details) and skips questions already answered
- Information preservation section — prompts instruct the AI to write thorough `companyDescription`, `goalDescription`, and `projectDescription` fields as the company's permanent record
- `launch-pack` preset — full executive team launch with CTO + CMO: strategy, tech, and marketing from day one
- 4 new modules: `codebase-onboarding` (audit existing codebases), `triage` (classify inbound GitHub issues), `dependency-management` (CVE scanning, safe patching), `release-management` (semver, changelogs, tagging)
- `repo-maintenance` preset — custodial maintenance for existing repos using the new modules

### Changed

- AI wizard config format: `extraModules`/`extraRoles` → `modules`/`roles` (all-inclusive lists that include preset defaults)
- AI wizard prompts now explicitly document that `engineer` is NOT a base role and must be listed for software projects
- Interview start message now includes the user's initial description (`{{DESCRIPTION}}`) so the AI has context from turn one
- Generate-config message reminds the AI to include all non-base roles and write thorough descriptions
- Single-shot system prompt restructured with numbered steps, "How Roles Work" section, and information preservation guidelines
- Template counts: 15 presets, 26 modules, 17 optional roles

### Fixed

- AI wizard no longer silently drops preset roles — `StepAiWizard` merges preset and AI-selected role arrays before dispatching
- Interview-mode template now passes `{{DESCRIPTION}}` in the start message (was previously blank, losing user context)

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- `publish:npm` and `prepublishOnly` scripts in `package.json` for streamlined npm publishing
- `files` whitelist in `package.json` to control published package contents

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-25

### Changed

- Updated plugin references and repository links to point to the new repo
- Updated favicon path and added new favicon SVG
- Updated author name in manifest

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-22

### Changed

- Version bump and manifest updates

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-18

Initial release of the plugin. Replaces the standalone Clipper CLI with a native Paperclip plugin.

### Added

- Interactive wizard UI (manual and AI-powered paths) for bootstrapping agent companies
- Preset, module, and role selection with hover-card detail previews and inline editing
- **Preview generated files** — collapsible file browser in the review step; each `.md` file can be expanded and edited before provisioning
- `preview-files` worker action: assembles to a temp dir and returns file contents without writing to disk
- `fileOverrides` support in `start-provision`: edits made in the UI are applied to assembled files before the API calls
- CEO adapter configuration (adapter type, working directory, model) in the wizard
- Real-time provisioning log streamed from the worker
- `check-auth` action for surfacing credential issues early (used by the summary step)
- Self-contained: templates, assembly logic, and API client are all bundled inside the plugin
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions) with pnpm, build, vitest, and node:test logic suite
- Pre-commit hook running prettier via lint-staged

### Template system

- 14 presets (fast, quality, rad, startup, research, full, secure, gtm, content, launch-mvp, build-api, website-relaunch, repo-maintenance, build-game)
- 22 modules across strategy, maintenance, and engineering workflow categories
- 17 optional roles (CEO is the only base role; Engineer is optional but included in most presets)
- All 22 modules now have `description` fields (previously only presets and roles had them)
- Engineer moved from base role to optional; added to 13 presets and to `pr-review`'s `activatesWithRoles`; task `assignTo` falls back to CEO if the named role is absent
- Gracefully optimistic capability resolution: responsibilities shift automatically as roles are added
- Inline goals with milestones and issues (from presets and modules)
- Heartbeat section injection into assembled `HEARTBEAT.md` files

### Configuration

- New `companiesDir` plugin setting — where assembled company workspaces are written. Defaults to `~/.paperclip/instances/default/companies`
- New `templatesRepoUrl` plugin setting — GitHub tree URL for auto-downloading templates. Defaults to the Yesterday-AI/paperclip-plugin-company-wizard repo
- `templatesPath` now defaults to `~/.paperclip/plugin-templates`, auto-downloaded from `templatesRepoUrl` if missing; falls back to bundled templates
- `sync-plugin.sh` added — syncs built artifacts and updates `manifest_json` in the Paperclip DB so schema changes are picked up on restart

### Bug fixes

- Bootstrap issue is now set to `todo` immediately after creation (was `backlog`, which the CEO agent inbox endpoint doesn't return)
- `issues.update` capability added to manifest to support the status update
- Generated files are now written directly to `companiesDir` — removes the container/host path split and fixes incorrect paths in the bootstrap issue description
- Improved loading screen: spinner + explanation that templates may be downloaded on first load

## Prior art

This plugin is derived from [`@yesterday-ai/paperclip-plugin-company-wizard`](https://github.com/Yesterday-AI/paperclip-plugin-company-wizard), the standalone Clipper CLI. See that project's changelog for history prior to this plugin.
