# Clipper

> Company as code. Bootstrap a [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) company workspace from modular templates.

Clipper assembles a ready-to-run company workspace by combining a base org structure with composable modules and optional roles. Capabilities adapt gracefully — adding a Product Owner makes it the primary owner of backlog management, with the CEO as automatic fallback.

## Install

```sh
npx @yesterday-ai/paperclipper
```

Or install globally:

```sh
npm i -g @yesterday-ai/paperclipper
clipper
```

Requires Node.js 20+.

## Usage

The interactive wizard walks through these steps:

```
$ clipper --api

```

`BOOTSTRAP.md` contains everything needed to set up the company in the Paperclip UI — goal, project with workspace and repo, agent paths, and initial tasks. With `--api`, all of this is provisioned automatically.

Files are read live by Paperclip agents — edit anything on disk and it takes effect on the next heartbeat.

## Gracefully Optimistic Architecture

Capabilities extend, they don't require. The system works with just CEO + Engineer, and gets better as you add roles:

| Capability | Primary Owner | Fallback |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- |
| roadmap-to-issues | Product Owner (if present) | CEO |
| auto-assign | Product Owner (if present) | CEO |
| pr-review | Activates with Code Reviewer or Product Owner | — |
| stall-detection | CEO (always) | — |

Primary owners get the full skill. Fallback owners get a safety-net variant that only activates when the primary is absent or stalled.

## Presets

| Preset | Roles | Modules | Best for |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| **fast** | CEO, Engineer | github-repo, roadmap-to-issues, auto-assign, stall-detection | Solo engineer, prototypes, MVPs |
| **quality** | CEO, Engineer, Product Owner, Code Reviewer | All 5 modules | Teams, production systems |

> **fast** is designed for a single engineer. Multiple engineers committing to main without review will cause conflicts.

## Modules

| Module | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| **github-repo** | Git workflow and commit conventions |
| **pr-review** | PR-based review (activates with code-reviewer or product-owner) |
| **roadmap-to-issues** | Auto-generates issues from goals when backlog runs low |
| **auto-assign** | Assigns unassigned issues to idle agents |
| **stall-detection** | Detects stuck handovers and nudges or escalates |

## After Clipper

### With `--api` (recommended)

Clipper provisions everything in the local Paperclip instance automatically:

1. **Company** — created with the name you entered
2. **Goal** — company-level goal with your title and description, set to `active`
3. **Project** — with a workspace pointing to the assembled directory (and GitHub repo if provided)
4. **Agents** — one per role, each with correct absolute `cwd`, `instructionsFilePath`, model, and adapter config from `role.json`
5. **Issues** — initial tasks from modules, linked to the goal and project

After provisioning, just start the CEO heartbeat.

### Without `--api`

Follow the `BOOTSTRAP.md` file generated in the company directory. It lists every resource to create manually in the Paperclip UI: company, goal, project with workspace, agents with paths, and initial issues.

## Extending

### Add a module

```text
templates/modules/<name>/
├── module.json                  # Name, capabilities, activatesWithRoles
├── README.md                    # Description
├── docs/                        # Shared docs (→ docs/)
└── agents/<role>/skills/        # Role skills (→ agents/<role>/skills/)
```

#### module.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "activatesWithRoles": ["my-role"],
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "skill": "my-skill",
      "owners": ["my-role", "ceo"],
      "fallbackSkill": "my-skill.fallback"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `activatesWithRoles` — module only applies if at least one of these roles is present
- `capabilities[].owners` — priority order; first present role gets the primary skill, others get fallback
- `capabilities[].fallbackSkill` — filename (without .md) of the fallback variant

### Add a role

```text
templates/roles/<name>/
├── role.json                    # Name, title, description, reportsTo, enhances, adapter
├── AGENTS.md
├── SOUL.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
└── TOOLS.md
```

#### role.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-role",
  "title": "My Role",
  "paperclipRole": "general",
  "description": "What this role does",
  "reportsTo": "ceo",
  "enhances": ["Takes over X from CEO"],
  "adapter": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "effort": "medium"
  }
}
```

- `paperclipRole` — maps to a Paperclip `AGENT_ROLE` enum: `ceo`, `engineer`, `pm`, `qa`, `designer`, `cto`, `cmo`, `cfo`, `devops`, `researcher`, `general`
- `adapter` — passed directly to `adapterConfig` during API provisioning. Supports any field the adapter accepts: `model`, `effort`, `maxTurnsPerRun`, etc. The `--model` CLI flag is used as fallback when `adapter.model` is not set.

### Add a preset

```json
{
  "name": "my-preset",
  "description": "What this preset is for",
  "constraints": [],
  "base": "base",
  "roles": ["product-owner"],
  "modules": ["github-repo", "roadmap-to-issues"]
}
```

## How It Works

The wizard collects: company name, goal, project (name + repo), preset, modules, and roles.

**Assembly** (always runs):

1. Copies base role files (CEO, Engineer) into `agents/`
2. Copies selected extra roles into `agents/`
3. For each module:
   - Checks `activatesWithRoles` — skips if required roles aren't present
   - Resolves capability ownership based on present roles
   - Primary owner gets the full skill; fallback owners get the safety-net variant
   - Copies shared docs into `docs/`
   - Appends skill and doc references to each AGENTS.md
4. Generates `BOOTSTRAP.md` with goal, project, agent paths, and initial tasks

**Provisioning** (with `--api`):

1. Creates company in Paperclip
2. Creates company-level goal (status: active)
3. Creates project with workspace (cwd → company dir, repo URL if provided)
4. Creates agents with per-role adapter config (`model`, `effort`, etc. from `role.json`)
5. Creates initial issues linked to goal and project
