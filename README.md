Clipper is a CLI and template system for [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) — the control plane for AI-agent companies. It assembles ready-to-run company workspaces by combining a base org (CEO + Engineer) with composable modules and optional specialist roles.

> **Gracefully optimistic:** capabilities extend, they don't require. The system works with just two roles and gets better as you add more. Adding a Product Owner shifts backlog management away from the CEO automatically. Adding a UX Researcher makes them the primary market analyst. No config changes needed.

<br>

## Quick Start

```sh
npx @yesterday-ai/paperclipper
```

That's it. The interactive wizard handles the rest. Add `--api` to auto-provision in your local Paperclip instance.

<br>

## Install

```sh
npx @yesterday-ai/paperclipper           # run directly (no install)
npm i -g @yesterday-ai/paperclipper      # or install globally → clipper
```

Requires **Node.js 20+**.

<br>

## Usage

The interactive wizard walks through these steps:

```text
$ clipper --api

  ╭──────────────╮
  │   Clipper    │
  ╰──────────────╯

  Company name: Acme Corp
  Company goal: Build the best widgets in the world
  Description:  Ship v1 with core features and onboard first 10 customers

  Project name: Acme Corp
  GitHub repo URL: https://github.com/acme/widgets

  Select a preset:
  ❯ fast — Speed-optimized for solo engineer...
    quality — Quality-optimized with PR review...
    rad — Rapid development with tech evaluation...
    startup — Strategy-first bootstrapping...
    research — Research and planning only...
    full — Full company setup with everything...

  ✓ Engineer agent created
  ✓ 4 issues created
  ✓ CEO heartbeat started
```

### Options

#### Company options

| Flag | Description | Default |
| :--- | :---------- | :------ |
| `--name <name>` | Company name | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--goal <title>` | Company goal title | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--goal-description <desc>` | Goal description | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--project <name>` | Project name | company name |
| `--project-description <desc>` | Project description | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--repo <url>` | GitHub repository URL | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--preset <name>` | Preset: `fast`, `quality`, `rad`, `startup`, `research`, `full` | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--modules <a,b,c>` | Comma-separated module names (merged with preset) | _(wizard prompt)_ |
| `--roles <a,b>` | Comma-separated extra role names (merged with preset) | _(wizard prompt)_ |

#### Infrastructure options

| Flag | Description | Default |
| :--- | :---------- | :------ |
| `--output <dir>` | Output directory for company workspaces | `./companies/` |
| `--api` | Provision via Paperclip API after file assembly | off |
| `--api-url <url>` | Paperclip API URL (implies `--api`) | `http://localhost:3100` |
| `--model <model>` | Default LLM model for all agents | adapter default |
| `--start` | Start CEO heartbeat after provisioning (implies `--api`) | off |
| `--ai` | AI interview: 3 guided questions, then auto-config | — |
| `--ai <desc>` | AI single-shot: describe company, auto-config | — |
| `--ai-model <model>` | Model for AI wizard | `claude-opus-4-6` |

> Company directories use PascalCase: `"Black Mesa"` becomes `companies/BlackMesa/`

### Non-interactive mode

Pass `--name` and `--preset` to skip the wizard entirely. No TTY required.

```sh
# Minimal — assemble files only
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast

# Full provisioning
clipper --name "Acme" --goal "Build widgets" --preset startup --api --start

# Custom composition
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast --roles product-owner --modules pr-review

# Preset with overrides
clipper --name "Acme" --preset custom --modules github-repo,auto-assign,stall-detection

# In a CI/CD pipeline or script
clipper --name "$COMPANY" --preset "$PRESET" --api --api-url "$API_URL" --start
```

`--modules` and `--roles` are additive — they merge with whatever the preset includes.

### AI wizard mode

Let Claude figure out the best setup. Two sub-modes — **interview** (3 guided questions) and **single-shot** (one description).

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — pass it inline or export it:

```sh
# Inline
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... clipper --ai

# Or export once
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

```sh
# Interview — AI asks 3 questions, each building on previous answers
clipper --ai

# Single-shot — describe everything upfront
clipper --ai "A fintech startup building a payment processing API, focus on security"

# Override AI choices with explicit flags
clipper --ai --name "PixelForge" --api
clipper --ai "Enterprise SaaS with CI/CD" --preset quality
```

The AI selects the best preset, modules, and roles based on your input. Explicit flags (`--name`, `--preset`, `--modules`, `--roles`) always override AI choices.

#### One-liner: description to running company

Combine single-shot with `--api` and `--start` for full programmatic integration — describe a company in natural language, assemble files, provision via API, and start the CEO heartbeat in one command:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... clipper --ai "A dev agency that builds React apps" --api --start
```

No prompts, no interaction, no TTY required — fully scriptable.

AI wizard prompts are stored in `templates/ai-wizard/` and can be edited to customize the wizard's behavior.

## Gracefully Optimistic Architecture

Capabilities extend, they don't require. Start with CEO + Engineer, add specialists as needed:

| Capability | Primary Owner | Fallback | Module |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------- | :----- |
| `market-analysis` | UX Researcher &rarr; CMO &rarr; Product Owner | CEO | market-analysis |
| `hiring-review` | Product Owner | CEO | hiring-review |
| `roadmap-to-issues` | Product Owner | CEO | roadmap-to-issues |
| `auto-assign` | Product Owner | CEO | auto-assign |
| `user-testing` | QA &rarr; UX Researcher &rarr; Product Owner | CEO | user-testing |
| `brand-identity` | UI Designer &rarr; CMO | CEO | brand-identity |
| `ci-cd` | DevOps | Engineer | ci-cd |
| `monitoring` | DevOps | Engineer | monitoring |
| `tech-stack` | Engineer | CEO | tech-stack |
| `architecture-plan` | Engineer | CEO | architecture-plan |
| `design-system` | UI Designer | Engineer | architecture-plan |
| `pr-review` | Code Reviewer / Product Owner / UI Designer / UX Researcher / QA / DevOps | — | pr-review |
| `stall-detection` | CEO (always) | — | stall-detection |
| `vision-workshop` | CEO (always) | — | vision-workshop |

**How it works:** Primary owners get the full skill. Fallback owners get a safety-net variant that only activates when the primary is absent or stalled.

> **Example:** With just CEO + Engineer, the CEO handles market analysis, hiring review, and backlog management alongside strategy. Add a Product Owner and those responsibilities shift automatically — the CEO's skills downgrade to fallback-only safety nets.

<br>

## Presets

| Preset | Modules | Best for |
| :----- | :------ | :------- |
| **`fast`** | github-repo, roadmap-to-issues, auto-assign, stall-detection | Solo engineer, prototypes, MVPs |
| **`quality`** | + pr-review, + Product Owner, + Code Reviewer | Teams, production systems |
| **`rad`** | + tech-stack, + hiring-review | Rapid prototyping, formalize later |
| **`startup`** | + vision, market, hiring, tech, architecture | Strategy-first, grow organically |
| **`research`** | vision, market, tech, hiring (no repo/code) | Planning phase only |
| **`full`** | All modules + Product Owner + Code Reviewer | Full planning + quality engineering |

> **`fast`** is for a single engineer — multiple engineers without review will cause conflicts.
>
> **`research`** has no code workflow. Add `github-repo` and `roadmap-to-issues` when ready to build.

<details>
<summary><strong>Preset details</strong></summary>

**fast** — Solo engineer, direct-to-main, automated backlog. No review, no planning phase.

**quality** — Full review pipeline. Product Owner manages backlog and product alignment, Code Reviewer gates code quality. Feature branches with PR workflow.

**rad** — Rapid Application Development. Pick a tech stack, start building, hire when you hit bottlenecks. No upfront market research or architecture formalization — prototype first, learn from what you build, formalize later.

**startup** — Strategy-first. Starts with vision, market analysis, tech evaluation, and hiring review before any code. CEO and Engineer grow the team through board approvals.

**research** — Planning only. Vision, market research, tech evaluation, and team assessment. No repo, no code workflow. Upgrade to `startup` or `full` when ready to build.

**full** — Everything. Full strategic planning, quality engineering with PR review, team growth via hiring review. Product Owner and Code Reviewer included. Best for serious projects that need both strategy and engineering rigor.

## After Clipper

### With `--api` (recommended)

Clipper provisions everything in the local Paperclip instance automatically:

1. **Company** — created with the name you entered
2. **Goal** — company-level goal, set to `active`
3. **Project** — workspace pointing to `companies/<Name>/projects/<ProjectName>/`
4. **Agents** — one per role, with `cwd`, `instructionsFilePath`, model, and adapter config
5. **Issues** — initial tasks from modules, linked to goal and project
6. **CEO heartbeat** — optionally started with `--start`

### Without `--api`

Follow the `BOOTSTRAP.md` file generated in the company directory. It lists every resource to create manually in the Paperclip UI.

<br>

## Extending

### Add a module

```text
templates/modules/<name>/
├── module.json                  # Name, capabilities, tasks, dependencies
├── skills/                      # Shared skills (used by any primary owner)
│   └── <skill>.md
├── agents/<role>/skills/        # Role-specific overrides and fallbacks
│   ├── <skill>.md               # Override (replaces shared for this role)
│   └── <skill>.fallback.md      # Fallback (safety-net for non-primary)
└── docs/                        # Shared docs (→ docs/)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>module.json schema</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "requires": ["other-module"],
  "activatesWithRoles": ["my-role"],
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "skill": "my-skill",
      "owners": ["my-role", "ceo"],
      "fallbackSkill": "my-skill.fallback"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Initial task",
      "assignTo": "capability:my-skill",
      "description": "Task description"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `requires` | Other modules that must be selected |
| `activatesWithRoles` | Module only applies if one of these roles is present |
| `capabilities[].owners` | Priority order — first present role gets the primary skill |
| `capabilities[].fallbackSkill` | Filename (without `.md`) of the fallback variant |
| `tasks[].assignTo` | A role name or `"capability:<skill>"` to auto-resolve |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skill resolution</strong></summary>

When assembling a capability's primary skill, the system checks in order:

1. **Role-specific override:** `agents/<role>/skills/<skill>.md`
2. **Shared skill:** `skills/<skill>.md`

First match wins. Most capabilities only need a shared skill. Role-specific overrides exist only when a role brings a genuinely different approach. Fallback variants are always role-specific.

```text
Example: market-analysis module
├── skills/
│   └── market-analysis.md                    # Shared: any primary owner
├── agents/
│   ├── ux-researcher/skills/
│   │   └── market-analysis.md                # Override: user-focused
│   └── ceo/skills/
│       └── market-analysis.fallback.md       # Fallback: brief overview
```

- **UX Researcher** present &rarr; gets role-specific override (user-focused)
- **Product Owner** primary &rarr; gets shared skill
- **CEO** primary &rarr; gets shared skill
- **CEO** as fallback &rarr; gets fallback variant

</details>

### Add a role

```text
templates/roles/<name>/
├── role.json        # Name, title, paperclipRole, reportsTo, adapter
├── AGENTS.md
├── SOUL.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
└── TOOLS.md
```

<details>
<summary><strong>role.json schema</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-role",
  "title": "My Role",
  "paperclipRole": "general",
  "description": "What this role does",
  "reportsTo": "ceo",
  "enhances": ["Takes over X from CEO"],
  "adapter": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `paperclipRole` | Paperclip enum: `ceo`, `engineer`, `pm`, `qa`, `designer`, `cto`, `cmo`, `cfo`, `devops`, `researcher`, `general` |
| `adapter` | Passed to `adapterConfig` during provisioning. `--model` CLI flag is fallback. |

</details>

### Add a preset

```json
{
  "name": "my-preset",
  "description": "What this preset is for",
  "constraints": [],
  "base": "base",
  "roles": ["product-owner"],
  "modules": ["github-repo", "roadmap-to-issues"]
}
```

<br>

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   Wizard    │────▶│   Assembly   │────▶│   Provisioning   │
│  (prompts)  │     │  (files)     │     │   (API, --api)   │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**Assembly** (always runs):

1. Copies base role files (CEO, Engineer) into `agents/`
2. Copies selected extra roles into `agents/`
3. For each module: resolves capability ownership, installs skills, copies docs
4. Generates `BOOTSTRAP.md` with goal, project, agent paths, and initial tasks

**Provisioning** (with `--api`):

1. Creates company &rarr; goal &rarr; project (with workspace) &rarr; agents &rarr; issues
2. Wires `reportsTo` hierarchy (CEO first, then other agents)
3. Optionally starts CEO heartbeat (`--start`)
