**Company Wizard** is a [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) plugin that bootstraps an AI agent company for your project — roles, workflows, skills, and tasks — in a few clicks. Open it from the sidebar, answer a few questions (or just describe your project), and it assembles the workspace files and creates the company + CEO in Paperclip. The CEO then hires the team and sets up the backlog on its first heartbeat.

<br>

**npm package installation (Paperclip > Settings > Plugins > Install Plugin):**

```bash
@yesterday-ai/paperclip-plugin-company-wizard

## Two Ways to Start

### AI mode

Describe your project in plain language. The wizard analyzes it and picks the right preset, modules, and roles automatically.

> *"A fintech startup building a payment API, security is critical"*
> → selects `secure` preset, Security Engineer + Product Owner roles, provisions everything

Great for getting started fast when you're not sure which template fits.

### Manual mode

Walk through the steps yourself: name your company, set a goal, pick a preset, add modules, choose roles. Each step shows descriptions and hover-card previews so you know what you're getting.

Before provisioning, you can **open any generated file and edit it inline** — tweak a persona, adjust a workflow, or add role-specific context.

<br>

## How Roles Work

Every company starts with just the **CEO** — and that's already a functional team. Add roles and responsibilities shift automatically:

- Add an **Engineer** → they take over implementation, git workflow, and technical decisions
- Add a **Product Owner** → they take over backlog management and auto-assignment from the CEO
- Add a **UX Researcher** → they become the primary market analyst
- Add **DevOps** → they own CI/CD and monitoring (instead of Engineer or CEO)

No role is ever truly missing. When a specialist isn't present, the next best available person steps in. The CEO is always the final fallback.

<details>
<summary><strong>Full capability ownership table</strong></summary>

Start with just a CEO. Everything works. Add roles and responsibilities shift automatically:

| Capability | Primary Owner | Fallback | Module |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------- | :----- |
| `market-analysis` | UX Researcher → CMO → Product Owner | CEO | market-analysis |
| `hiring-review` | Product Owner | CEO | hiring-review |
| `backlog-health` | Product Owner | CEO | backlog |
| `auto-assign` | Product Owner | CEO | auto-assign |
| `user-testing` | QA → UX Researcher → Product Owner | CEO | user-testing |
| `brand-identity` | UI Designer → CMO | CEO | brand-identity |
| `ci-cd` | DevOps | Engineer | ci-cd |
| `monitoring` | DevOps | Engineer | monitoring |
| `tech-stack` | Engineer | CEO | tech-stack |
| `architecture-plan` | Engineer | CEO | architecture-plan |
| `design-system` | UI Designer | Engineer | architecture-plan |
| `pr-review` | Code Reviewer / Product Owner / UI Designer / UX Researcher / QA / DevOps | — | pr-review |
| `threat-model` | Security Engineer → DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `security-review` | Security Engineer → DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `project-docs` | Technical Writer → Engineer | CEO | documentation |
| `competitive-tracking` | Customer Success → CMO → Product Owner | CEO | competitive-intel |
| `accessibility-audit` | QA → UI Designer | Engineer | accessibility |
| `codebase-audit` | Engineer | CEO | codebase-onboarding |
| `issue-triage` | Product Owner → Engineer | CEO | triage |
| `dependency-audit` | DevOps → Security Engineer | Engineer | dependency-management |
| `release-process` | DevOps → Engineer | CEO | release-management |
| `game-design` | Game Designer → Engineer | CEO | game-design |
| `stall-detection` | CEO (always) | — | stall-detection |
| `vision-workshop` | CEO (always) | — | vision-workshop |

**How it works:** Primary owners get the full skill. Fallback owners get a safety-net variant that only activates when the primary is absent or stalled.

> **Example:** CEO only? They handle everything — strategy, backlog, auto-assign. Add an Engineer and they take over implementation. Add a Product Owner and they take over backlog management, with the CEO as fallback.

## Presets

Presets are curated starting points that bundle a set of modules and optional roles for a specific use case. Pick one in the wizard and you're ready to go — or use it as a base and add modules on top.

| Preset | Modules | Best for |
| :----- | :------ | :------- |
| **`fast`** | github-repo, backlog, auto-assign, stall-detection | Solo engineer, prototypes, MVPs |
| **`quality`** | + pr-review, + Product Owner, + Code Reviewer | Teams, production systems |

<details>
<summary><strong>Preset details</strong></summary>

**fast** — Solo engineer, direct-to-main, automated backlog. No review, no planning phase.

**quality** — Full review pipeline. Product Owner manages backlog and product alignment, Code Reviewer gates code quality. Feature branches with PR workflow.

**rad** — Rapid Application Development. Pick a tech stack, start building, hire when you hit bottlenecks. No upfront market research or architecture formalization — prototype first, learn from what you build, formalize later.

**startup** — Strategy-first. Starts with vision, market analysis, tech evaluation, and hiring review before any code. Grow the team through board approvals.

**research** — Planning only. Vision, market research, tech evaluation, and team assessment. No repo, no code workflow. Upgrade to `startup` or `full` when ready to build.

**full** — Everything. Full strategic planning, quality engineering with PR review, team growth via hiring review. Product Owner and Code Reviewer included. Best for serious projects that need both strategy and engineering rigor.

**secure** — Security-first. Threat modeling, security reviews, and quality gates on top of full planning and PR review. Security Engineer, Code Reviewer, and Product Owner included. Best for regulated industries, fintech, healthtech, or any project where security is a hard requirement.

**gtm** — Go-to-market focused. Competitive intelligence, market analysis, and brand identity. CMO for marketing strategy, Customer Success for competitive tracking, Product Owner for backlog. Best for products entering or competing in established markets.

**content** — Content and documentation focused. Technical Writer for developer docs and guides, accessibility for inclusive design, market analysis for positioning. Best for developer tools, documentation-heavy projects, or content-driven products.

**website-relaunch** — Relaunch an existing website with external design assets. Site audit, design ingestion, implementation, content migration, QA, and go-live. UI Designer for design analysis, Product Owner for backlog management. Includes a user-assigned "Provide design assets" issue as the entry point — upload your agency's designs, the team handles the rest.

**repo-maintenance** — Custodial maintenance for existing repositories. Agents review and merge open PRs, triage inbound GitHub issues, audit codebase health, manage dependencies, and handle releases. Code Reviewer for PR quality gates, Product Owner for issue triage and backlog. Inline goal bootstraps the team through repo onboarding, process setup, initial sweep, and steady-state maintenance.

**build-game** — Game development from idea to playable release. Game Designer owns the GDD, mechanics, and balancing. Game Artist generates sprites, textures, and tilesets via AI image generation and code-based approaches. Audio Designer creates sound effects, music, and soundscapes via AI generation and code-based synthesis. Inline goal with 5 milestones: concept (GDD + engine + art style), prototype (core loop + placeholder art + first playtest), vertical slice (one polished level), production (all content), polish & ship (balancing + distribution). Works for any genre.

## Modules

Modules are composable capabilities you layer on top of the base team. Each module adds skills, tasks, and optionally heartbeat sections to the relevant roles. Modules are additive — you can combine them freely and they degrade gracefully when a role they extend isn't present.

| `tasks[].assignTo` | A role name or `"capability:<skill>"` to auto-resolve |
| `adapterOverrides` | Adapter config keys merged into all capability owner agents during provisioning |
| `goal` | Optional inline goal. When active, `tasks` are skipped. |
| `goal.project` | If `true` (default), creates a dedicated Paperclip project for this goal |
| `goal.issues[].assignTo` | Role name, `"capability:<skill>"`, or `"user"` (human pickup) |

<summary><strong>Skill resolution</strong></summary>

When assembling a capability's primary skill, the system checks in order:

1. **Role-specific override:** `agents/<role>/skills/<skill>.md`
2. **Shared skill:** `skills/<skill>.md`

First match wins. Most capabilities only need a shared skill. Role-specific overrides exist only when a role brings a genuinely different approach.

```text
Example: market-analysis module
├── skills/
│   └── market-analysis.md                    # Shared: any primary owner
├── agents/
│   ├── ux-researcher/skills/
│   │   └── market-analysis.md                # Override: user-focused
│   └── ceo/skills/
│       └── market-analysis.fallback.md       # Fallback: brief overview
```

- **UX Researcher** present → gets role-specific override (user-focused)
- **Product Owner** primary → gets shared skill
- **CEO** as fallback → gets fallback variant

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Doc references in skills</strong></summary>

Two kinds of docs end up in `{company}/docs/`:

- **Templates** (`lowercase-kebab.md`) — Shipped by modules, copied at assembly time. Guaranteed to exist if the module is active.
- **Agent output** (`UPPERCASE.md`) — Created by agents during execution. May or may not exist yet.

| Reference | Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Define own output | Name the path directly | "Document in `docs/TECH-STACK.md`" |
| Read own template | Reference directly | "Follow conventions in `docs/pr-conventions.md`" |
| Read cross-module output | **Always conditional** | "If `docs/TECH-STACK.md` exists, review it. Otherwise, proceed based on project context." |

### Add a role

```text
templates/roles/<name>/
├── role.meta.json   # Name, title, base, paperclipRole, reportsTo, adapter
├── AGENTS.md
├── SOUL.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
└── TOOLS.md
```

<details>
<summary><strong>role.meta.json schema</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-role",
  "title": "My Role",
  "base": false,
  "division": "engineering",
  "tagline": "One-liner for wizard display and AI selection",
  "paperclipRole": "general",
  "description": "What this role does",
  "reportsTo": "ceo",
  "enhances": ["Takes over X from CEO"],
  "adapter": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `base` | `true` for always-present roles (ceo only) |
| `division` | Grouping: `leadership`, `engineering`, `design`, `product` |
| `tagline` | One-liner for wizard UX and AI selection |
| `paperclipRole` | Paperclip enum: `ceo`, `engineer`, `pm`, `qa`, `designer`, `cto`, `cmo`, `cfo`, `devops`, `researcher`, `general` |
| `adapter` | Passed to `adapterConfig` during provisioning |

</details>

### Add a preset

Create `templates/presets/<name>/preset.meta.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-preset",
  "description": "What this preset is for",
  "constraints": [],
  "roles": ["product-owner"],
  "modules": ["github-repo", "backlog"]
}
```

## How It Works

```text
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   Wizard    │────▶│   Assembly   │────▶│   Provisioning   │
│   (UI)      │     │  (files)     │     │   (Paperclip API)│
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**Assembly** (always runs):

1. Copies base role files (CEO, Engineer) into `agents/`
2. Copies selected extra roles into `agents/`
3. For each module: resolves capability ownership, installs skills, copies docs
4. Injects module heartbeat sections into each role's `HEARTBEAT.md`
5. Generates `BOOTSTRAP.md` with goal, project, agent paths, and initial tasks

**Provisioning** (Review → Provision step):

1. Connects to Paperclip API (auto-detects `local_trusted` vs authenticated)
2. Creates a new **company** in Paperclip — or targets an existing one if `existingCompanyId` is set in the review step
3. Creates the **CEO agent** with adapter config (cwd, instructionsFilePath, model), or reuses the existing active CEO when targeting an existing company. If board approval is required, the wizard hires via `/agent-hires` and auto-approves
4. Creates a **Bootstrap task** assigned to the CEO

The CEO then sets up the rest of the team on its first heartbeat: hiring the other roles from disk, creating the goal, project, and initial backlog issues. If provisioning fails after a **new** company is created, the partial company is automatically deleted — existing target companies are never deleted on error.
