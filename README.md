> **Development Preview:** A Paperclip plugin version of Clipper with a web UI is in active development. See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for details.

---

Clipper is a CLI and template system for [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) — the control plane for AI-agent companies. It assembles ready-to-run company workspaces by combining a base org (CEO + Engineer) with composable modules and optional specialist roles.

> **Gracefully optimistic:** capabilities extend, they don't require. The system works with just two roles and gets better as you add more. Adding a Product Owner shifts backlog management away from the CEO automatically. Adding a UX Researcher makes them the primary market analyst. No config changes needed.

## Quick Start

```sh
npx @yesterday-ai/paperclipper
```

That's it. The interactive wizard handles the rest. Add `--api` to auto-provision in your local Paperclip instance.

<br>

## Install

```sh
npx @yesterday-ai/paperclipper           # run directly (no install)
npm i -g @yesterday-ai/paperclipper      # or install globally → clipper
```

Requires **Node.js 20+**.

<br>

## Usage

The interactive wizard walks through these steps:

```text
$ clipper --api

> Company directories use PascalCase: `"Black Mesa"` becomes `companies/BlackMesa/`

### Non-interactive mode

Pass `--name` and `--preset` to skip the wizard entirely. No TTY required.

```sh
# Minimal — assemble files only
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast

# Full provisioning
clipper --name "Acme" --goal "Build widgets" --preset startup --api --start

# Custom composition
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast --roles product-owner --modules pr-review

# Preset with overrides
clipper --name "Acme" --preset custom --modules github-repo,auto-assign,stall-detection

# In a CI/CD pipeline or script
clipper --name "$COMPANY" --preset "$PRESET" --api --api-url "$API_URL" --start
```

`--modules` and `--roles` are additive — they merge with whatever the preset includes.

> **Goal generation:** [Paperize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paperize) distills notes, ideas, research, or Obsidian vaults into actionable goals via AI. Use it to generate goals for Clipper programmatically: `npx paperize --source ~/notes`.

### AI wizard mode

Let Claude figure out the best setup. Two sub-modes — **interview** (3 guided questions) and **single-shot** (one description).

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — pass it inline or export it:

```sh
# Inline
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... clipper --ai

# Or export once
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

```sh
# Interview — AI asks 3 questions, each building on previous answers
clipper --ai

# Single-shot — describe everything upfront
clipper --ai "A fintech startup building a payment processing API, focus on security"

# Override AI choices with explicit flags
clipper --ai --name "PixelForge" --api
clipper --ai "Enterprise SaaS with CI/CD" --preset quality
```

The AI selects the best preset, modules, and roles based on your input. Explicit flags (`--name`, `--preset`, `--modules`, `--roles`) always override AI choices.

#### One-liner: description to running company

Combine single-shot with `--api` and `--start` for full programmatic integration — describe a company in natural language, assemble files, provision via API, and start the CEO heartbeat in one command:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... clipper --ai "A dev agency that builds React apps" --api --start
```

No prompts, no interaction, no TTY required — fully scriptable.

AI wizard prompts are stored in `templates/ai-wizard/` and can be edited to customize the wizard's behavior.

## Gracefully Optimistic Architecture

Start with CEO + Engineer. Everything works. Add specialists and responsibilities shift automatically:

| Capability | Primary Owner | Fallback | Module |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------- | :----- |
| `market-analysis` | UX Researcher &rarr; CMO &rarr; Product Owner | CEO | market-analysis |
| `hiring-review` | Product Owner | CEO | hiring-review |
| `backlog-health` | Product Owner | CEO | backlog |
| `auto-assign` | Product Owner | CEO | auto-assign |
| `user-testing` | QA &rarr; UX Researcher &rarr; Product Owner | CEO | user-testing |
| `brand-identity` | UI Designer &rarr; CMO | CEO | brand-identity |
| `ci-cd` | DevOps | Engineer | ci-cd |
| `monitoring` | DevOps | Engineer | monitoring |
| `tech-stack` | Engineer | CEO | tech-stack |
| `architecture-plan` | Engineer | CEO | architecture-plan |
| `design-system` | UI Designer | Engineer | architecture-plan |
| `pr-review` | Code Reviewer / Product Owner / UI Designer / UX Researcher / QA / DevOps | — | pr-review |
| `threat-model` | Security Engineer &rarr; DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `security-review` | Security Engineer &rarr; DevOps | Engineer | security-audit |
| `project-docs` | Technical Writer &rarr; Engineer | CEO | documentation |
| `competitive-tracking` | Customer Success &rarr; CMO &rarr; Product Owner | CEO | competitive-intel |
| `accessibility-audit` | QA &rarr; UI Designer | Engineer | accessibility |
| `codebase-audit` | Engineer | CEO | codebase-onboarding |
| `issue-triage` | Product Owner &rarr; Engineer | CEO | triage |
| `dependency-audit` | DevOps &rarr; Security Engineer | Engineer | dependency-management |
| `release-process` | DevOps &rarr; Engineer | CEO | release-management |
| `stall-detection` | CEO (always) | — | stall-detection |
| `vision-workshop` | CEO (always) | — | vision-workshop |

**How it works:** Primary owners get the full skill. Fallback owners get a safety-net variant that only activates when the primary is absent or stalled.

> **Example:** CEO + Engineer only? The CEO handles market analysis, hiring review, and backlog management alongside strategy. Add a Product Owner and those responsibilities shift automatically — the CEO keeps a fallback safety net but steps back from day-to-day.

<br>

> **`research`** has no code workflow. Add `github-repo` and `backlog` when ready to build.

<details>
<summary><strong>Preset details</strong></summary>

**fast** — Solo engineer, direct-to-main, automated backlog. No review, no planning phase.

**quality** — Full review pipeline. Product Owner manages backlog and product alignment, Code Reviewer gates code quality. Feature branches with PR workflow.

**rad** — Rapid Application Development. Pick a tech stack, start building, hire when you hit bottlenecks. No upfront market research or architecture formalization — prototype first, learn from what you build, formalize later.

**startup** — Strategy-first. Starts with vision, market analysis, tech evaluation, and hiring review before any code. CEO and Engineer grow the team through board approvals.

**research** — Planning only. Vision, market research, tech evaluation, and team assessment. No repo, no code workflow. Upgrade to `startup` or `full` when ready to build.

**full** — Everything. Full strategic planning, quality engineering with PR review, team growth via hiring review. Product Owner and Code Reviewer included. Best for serious projects that need both strategy and engineering rigor.

**secure** — Security-first. Threat modeling, security reviews, and quality gates on top of full planning and PR review. Security Engineer, Code Reviewer, and Product Owner included. Best for regulated industries, fintech, healthtech, or any project where security is a hard requirement.

**gtm** — Go-to-market focused. Competitive intelligence, market analysis, and brand identity. CMO for marketing strategy, Customer Success for competitive tracking, Product Owner for backlog. Best for products entering or competing in established markets.

**content** — Content and documentation focused. Technical Writer for developer docs and guides, accessibility for inclusive design, market analysis for positioning. Best for developer tools, documentation-heavy projects, or content-driven products.

**website-relaunch** — Relaunch an existing website with external design assets. Site audit, design ingestion, implementation, content migration, QA, and go-live. UI Designer for design analysis, Product Owner for backlog management. Includes a user-assigned "Provide design assets" issue as the entry point — upload your agency's designs, the team handles the rest.

**repo-maintenance** — Custodial maintenance for existing repositories. Agents review and merge open PRs, triage inbound GitHub issues, audit codebase health, manage dependencies, and handle releases. Code Reviewer for PR quality gates, Product Owner for issue triage and backlog. Inline goal bootstraps the team through repo onboarding, process setup, initial sweep, and steady-state maintenance.

## After Clipper

### With `--api` (recommended)

For `local_trusted` instances, `--api` works without credentials. For authenticated instances, provide board login credentials via env vars or flags:

```sh
# Env vars (set once)
export PAPERCLIP_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export PAPERCLIP_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast --api

# Or inline flags
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast --api \
  --api-email you@example.com --api-password yourpassword
```

Clipper auto-detects whether authentication is needed — no configuration change required for `local_trusted` instances.

For Docker deployments where the workspace is mounted at a different path, use `--api-workspace-root` to remap paths:

```sh
# Local: companies/ is mounted into Docker at /data/companies/
clipper --name "Acme" --preset fast --api \
  --api-workspace-root /data/companies
```

Clipper provisions everything in the Paperclip instance automatically:

1. **Company** — created with the name you entered
2. **Goal** — company-level goal, set to `active`
3. **Project** — workspace pointing to `companies/<Name>/projects/<ProjectName>/`
4. **Agents** — one per role, with `cwd`, `instructionsFilePath`, model, and adapter config
5. **Issues** — initial tasks from modules, linked to goal and project
6. **CEO heartbeat** — optionally started with `--start`

### Without `--api`

Follow the `BOOTSTRAP.md` file generated in the company directory. It lists every resource to create manually in the Paperclip UI.

## Extending

### Add a module

```text
templates/modules/<name>/
├── module.meta.json             # Name, capabilities, tasks, dependencies, permissions
├── skills/                      # Shared skills (used by any primary owner)
│   └── <skill>.md
├── agents/<role>/
│   ├── skills/                  # Role-specific overrides and fallbacks
│   │   ├── <skill>.md           # Override (replaces shared for this role)
│   │   └── <skill>.fallback.md  # Fallback (safety-net for non-primary)
│   └── heartbeat-section.md     # Optional: injected into role's HEARTBEAT.md
└── docs/                        # Shared docs (→ docs/)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Doc references in skills</strong></summary>

Two kinds of docs end up in `{company}/docs/`:

- **Templates** (`lowercase-kebab.md`) — Shipped by modules, copied at assembly time. Guaranteed to exist if the module is active.
- **Agent output** (`UPPERCASE.md`) — Created by agents during execution. May or may not exist yet.

| Reference | Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Define own output | Name the path directly | "Document in `docs/TECH-STACK.md`" |
| Read own template | Reference directly (assembly guarantees it) | "Follow conventions in `docs/pr-conventions.md`" |
| Read cross-module output | **Always conditional** with graceful fallback | "If `docs/TECH-STACK.md` exists, review it. Otherwise, proceed based on project context." |

The naming convention is the contract: `UPPERCASE.md` from another module → always wrap in "if exists". `lowercase.md` from own module → safe to reference directly.

<summary><strong>module.meta.json schema</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "requires": ["other-module"],
  "activatesWithRoles": ["my-role"],
  "permissions": ["tasks:assign"],
  "adapterOverrides": { "chrome": true },

    {
      "skill": "my-skill",
      "owners": ["my-role", "ceo"],
      "fallbackSkill": "my-skill.fallback"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Initial task",
      "assignTo": "capability:my-skill",
      "description": "Task description"
    }
  ],
  "goal": {
    "title": "My Goal",
    "description": "What this goal achieves",
    "project": true,
    "milestones": [
      { "id": "phase-1", "title": "Phase 1", "project": false }
    ],
    "issues": [
      { "title": "First task", "milestone": "phase-1", "assignTo": "engineer", "priority": "high" }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `requires` | Other modules that must be selected |
| `activatesWithRoles` | Module only applies if one of these roles is present |
| `capabilities[].owners` | Priority order — first present role gets the primary skill |
| `capabilities[].fallbackSkill` | Filename (without `.md`) of the fallback variant |
| `tasks[].assignTo` | A role name or `"capability:<skill>"` to auto-resolve |
| `adapterOverrides` | Adapter config keys merged into all capability owner agents during provisioning (e.g., `{ "chrome": true }`) |
| `goal` | Optional inline goal with milestones and issues. When active, `tasks` are skipped. |
| `goal.project` | If `true` (default), creates a dedicated Paperclip project for this goal |
| `goal.issues[].assignTo` | Role name, `"capability:<skill>"`, or `"user"` (unassigned for human pickup) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skill resolution</strong></summary>

When assembling a capability's primary skill, the system checks in order:

1. **Role-specific override:** `agents/<role>/skills/<skill>.md`
2. **Shared skill:** `skills/<skill>.md`

First match wins. Most capabilities only need a shared skill. Role-specific overrides exist only when a role brings a genuinely different approach. Fallback variants are always role-specific.

```text
Example: market-analysis module
├── skills/
│   └── market-analysis.md                    # Shared: any primary owner
├── agents/
│   ├── ux-researcher/skills/
│   │   └── market-analysis.md                # Override: user-focused
│   └── ceo/skills/
│       └── market-analysis.fallback.md       # Fallback: brief overview
```

- **UX Researcher** present &rarr; gets role-specific override (user-focused)
- **Product Owner** primary &rarr; gets shared skill
- **CEO** primary &rarr; gets shared skill
- **CEO** as fallback &rarr; gets fallback variant

</details>

### Add a role

```text
templates/roles/<name>/
├── role.meta.json   # Name, title, base, paperclipRole, reportsTo, adapter
├── AGENTS.md
├── SOUL.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md
└── TOOLS.md
```

<details>
<summary><strong>role.meta.json schema</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-role",
  "title": "My Role",
  "base": false,
  "division": "engineering",
  "tagline": "One-liner for wizard display and AI selection",
  "paperclipRole": "general",
  "description": "What this role does",
  "reportsTo": "ceo",
  "enhances": ["Takes over X from CEO"],
  "adapter": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `base` | `true` for always-present roles (ceo, engineer). Omit or `false` for optional roles. |
| `division` | Functional grouping: `leadership`, `engineering`, `design`, `product`. Used for wizard display and AI selection. |
| `tagline` | One-liner personality summary for wizard UX and AI wizard selection. |
| `paperclipRole` | Paperclip enum: `ceo`, `engineer`, `pm`, `qa`, `designer`, `cto`, `cmo`, `cfo`, `devops`, `researcher`, `general` |
| `adapter` | Passed to `adapterConfig` during provisioning. `--model` CLI flag is fallback. |

</details>

### Add a preset

Create `templates/presets/<name>/preset.meta.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-preset",
  "description": "What this preset is for",
  "constraints": [],
  "roles": ["product-owner"],
  "modules": ["github-repo", "backlog"]
}
```

<br>

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   Wizard    │────▶│   Assembly   │────▶│   Provisioning   │
│  (prompts)  │     │  (files)     │     │   (API, --api)   │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**Assembly** (always runs):

1. Copies base role files (CEO, Engineer) into `agents/`
2. Copies selected extra roles into `agents/`
3. For each module: resolves capability ownership, installs skills, copies docs
4. Injects module heartbeat sections into each role's `HEARTBEAT.md`
5. Generates `BOOTSTRAP.md` with goal, project, agent paths, and initial tasks

**Provisioning** (with `--api`):

1. Connects to Paperclip API (auto-detects `local_trusted` vs authenticated, resolves board user ID)
2. Creates company &rarr; goal &rarr; project (with workspace) &rarr; agents (with adapter config from role + module `adapterOverrides`) &rarr; module task issues
3. For each inline goal (from preset/modules): sub-goal &rarr; optional project &rarr; milestones &rarr; issues
4. Issues with `assignTo: "user"` are assigned to the board user; agent issues are assigned to the matching agent
5. Wires `reportsTo` hierarchy (CEO first, then other agents)
6. Optionally starts CEO heartbeat (`--start`)
