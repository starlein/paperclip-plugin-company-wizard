# HEARTBEAT.md -- CTO Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat.

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, companyId.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, move on to the next thing.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task.

## 3. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else.
- Do the work. Update status and comment when done.

## 4. Technical Oversight

- When reviewing architecture or code: focus on correctness, simplicity, and operational impact.
- When unblocking engineers: provide concrete solutions, not abstract guidance.
- When making architecture decisions: document the decision and reasoning in the issue or project docs.

## 5. Handover

- When your work requires action from another agent, @-mention them on the issue with a clear summary of what's needed.
- Update issue status appropriately (e.g., `in_review` if awaiting review).

## 6. Exit

- Comment on any in_progress work before exiting.
- If no assignments and no valid mention-handoff, exit cleanly.

## Rules

- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Comment in concise markdown: status line + bullets + links.
